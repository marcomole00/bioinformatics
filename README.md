# Bioinformatic Algorithms

some scripts and algorithm implementations based on the content of the Bioinformatic Algorithms course AA 2021/2022 

### De-bruijn.py
This is a script that generates a De-Bruijn graph constructed from a DNA sequence. 
The script will output two .dot files.
1) graph.dot generates only the de-bruijn graph
2) graph_path.dot will generate, if possibile, an Eulerian path. 
    - this file will not be created if the graph is not traversable. 

The example is generated by the sequence TCATTCTTCAGGTCAAA.
#### how to run the script
```bash
$ python3 de-bruijn.py 
```

In order to generate the .svg image of the graph install [graphwiz](https://graphviz.org). 
Then run 
```bash
$ dot -Tsvg (filename).dot > (output_name).svg
```

### minimum_edit_distance.py

It will find possibile alignments based on a minimum edit distance criteria with zero weight. The metric used is the Levenshtein distance. Support for weights will arrive in future commits.
```bash
$ python3 minimum_edit_distance.py
```
